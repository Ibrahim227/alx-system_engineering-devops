Command line for the win:  CMD CHALLENGE is a pretty cool game challenging you on Bash skills. Everything is done via the command line and the questions are becoming increasingly complicated. Itâ€™s a good training to improve your command line skills!


STEPS I followed:

RESOLVE the challenge to challenge 9;
take screenshot;
Connected to SFTP server with my local terminal;
change the remote working diretory from / to /root/alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win/
